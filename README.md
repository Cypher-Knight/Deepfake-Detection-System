# Deepfake-Detection-System
Unleash the truth! This project exposes deepfakes with deep learning. It combines pre-trained RestNext for image analysis with LSTM's memory for video sequences. By feeding RestNext's insights to LSTM, it learns to spot inconsistencies in manipulated videos.

## **Installation & Execution**
1. Download Trained Models:- [OneDrive](https://bit.ly/3wC9xX3)
2. save the models in ```main/models/``` directory.
3. Install dependencies from the requirements.txt
4. Run the web application.
5. Then adjust the frames you want to examine. As example I have taken 20 frames. ![Image title](Test%20Footage/image1.png)
6. Then fetch the video footage that you want to examine as shown below. ![Image title](Test%20Footage/image2.png)
7. Then Execute.
